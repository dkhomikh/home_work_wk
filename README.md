0.browser automation test project
1.project references (jar files are not included into POM.xml  and should be added manually to project. Jar files: selenium-java-2.45.0.jar, selenium-java-2.45.0.jar, selenium-server-standalone-2.47.1.jar
for chromedriver: chromedriver.exe (for windows only)
2. Code is completely functional and has been tested for both happy / unhappy passes. I have written wrappers around webdriver methods to simplify expansion of functionality if needed and to enhance robustness of the tests.
3. All values are hard coded due to nature of the project (homework) Implementation would be different for real project: either properties file, external config file, etc.
4. Logging has been simplified as System.out... due to nature of the project (homework) and implementation would be different such as java logger (for example)
5. Code is not hooked to any test framework (Cucumber, etc.) due to time constrains, just self contained java code
5. All validations are limited or simplified. Real implementation would include more validations and checkpoints, validations within test framework
